## My game direction

Throughout my process of learning about game development I have decided to experience with multiple genres. Many of the game protypes in this website came from wanting to try to create fun and interactive mechanics. The following games are gameplay centric and vary in what I was experimenting with.

## Medieval Survival Game

This is one of my first attempts at creating a more complex game. The goal of the game is to gather resources by allocating your units and trying to keep your people happy. There is time pressure so there is a element of strategy to it.

## Puzzle Game

This is a first person puzzle game where you have to walk around the world and solve puzzles to access the campfire. The main mechanic of this prototype revolves around the idea of grid puzzles that are not directly explained to the player. My aim here was to provide introductory puzzles so that the player could learn by doing.

## Breakout Roguelike

The idea for this game was to try to implement roguelike elements to breakout. The way I did it is by mputting more emphasis on the bricks instead of the actual paddle which made it into a strategy game. I tried to add variety in the type of bricks you could have to allow different strategies and also provide outside buffs that could also change the approach to building the board.

## Shield Platformer

A simple 2D platformer where the main mechanic is to use arrow keys to change the position of your shield so that you can bounce of spikes, there is a huge emphasis on momentum and challenge which is why there are optional collectibles and each room has its own checkpoint.

## Captain Simulator

This prototype is focused on pathfinding the player is tasked with commanding a pirate ship to success. In it the player can change the target based on what they believe is relevant as distance, health, and firepower. The game utilizes its own A* algorithm to handle how the pathing is done for both the player and the enemies. Additionally the "water" dynamically changes based on its surrounding.

## Simple Grid Pathfinding Analyzer

This is not a game but it is a neat project that focuses on camparing, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Greedy Search, A*, and a random search. It allows whoever wants to use it to expermient with different layouts and different amount of objectives for the pathing algorithms to do.
